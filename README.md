# The Problem

Data is a great way to make a point and tell a story. However, to gather, vet,
and visualize data and content for reporting and presentations is time
consuming. 

This challenge seeks to develop a mechanism for automatic
report generation through pre-vetted authoritative data via the Aloha+
Challenge Dashboard.
Thoughts on what is
needed

Platform (if any): Aloha+ Dashboard (open data platform on Hawaii.gov site)
Thoughts: The data on the Aloha+ Dashboard is vetted through 500+ crosssector stakeholders and Aloha+ signatories (Governor, County Mayors, and
Office of Hawaiian Affairs)
Project Value
(Department - Government -
Community - Industry)
Ability to generate reports efficiently using choice authoritative from vetted
source.
